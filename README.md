# Linear-Algebra-Theory-Implementation
This course was offered by Dr.Mike X Cohen on Udemy. The course gives in depth information of Linear Algebra. Topics like Vectors, Matrices, Eigenvectors, Singular Value Decomposition etc are covered in depth with some practical examples and its implementation in MATLAB or Python programming language.

Files includes all the code challenges that are present in the course. All the challenges in the course are done in Matlab. While I have implemented the same code challenges in Python.
